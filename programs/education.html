            <h1>EDUCATION PROGRAM</h1>
            <h2>Education, Nutrition and Holistic Development of Children</h2>

            <p>At Gandhiji Seva Sangam, we firmly believe that education is the cornerstone of social transformation. Our Education Program is designed to provide underprivileged children from rural communities with access to quality education, nutritious meals, and comprehensive developmental support that nurtures their physical, mental, and emotional growth.</p>

            <div class="program-highlight">
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>To ensure every child, regardless of their socio-economic background, has the opportunity to receive quality education and develop their full potential through holistic support systems.</p>
            </div>
