            <h1>HEALTHCARE PROGRAM</h1>
            <h2>Taking Healthcare Services to Doorsteps of Hard to Reach Communities</h2>

            <p>Healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet millions in rural India lack access to basic medical services. Gandhiji Seva Sangam's Healthcare Program bridges this critical gap by bringing quality healthcare directly to remote and underserved communities across Tamil Nadu. Through mobile health camps, preventive care initiatives, and health awareness programs, we ensure that geography and poverty are no longer barriers to good health.</p>

            <div class="program-highlight">

                <p>To create healthy, resilient communities where every individual has access to affordable, quality healthcare services regardless of their location or economic status.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Program Components</h2>

                <h3>Success Story</h3>
                <p><em>"Lakshmi, a 62-year-old widow from a remote village, had been suffering from undiagnosed diabetes for years. During one of our health camps, she was screened and found to have dangerously high blood sugar levels. Our team provided her with free medication, dietary counseling, and regular follow-up care. Today, her diabetes is well-controlled, and she actively participates in our health awareness programs, encouraging other villagers to get regular check-ups."</em></p>
