            <h1>EMPOWERING GRASSROOTS PROGRAM</h1>
            <h2>Helping Community-Based Organizations Become Locally Sustainable</h2>

            <p>Sustainable development requires strong, capable community-based organizations (CBOs) that can identify local needs, mobilize resources, and implement solutions independently. Gandhiji Seva Sangam's Empowering Grassroots Program builds the capacity of village-level organizations, self-help groups, youth clubs, and community collectives, transforming them into self-reliant institutions that drive their own development agendas without perpetual external dependence.</p>

            <div class="program-highlight">
                <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                <p>"Give a person a fish, and you feed them for a day. Teach them to fish, and you feed them for a lifetime. Empower the community to manage its own fishery, and you transform the entire village." - We believe in building local institutions, not creating dependencies.</p>

            <div class="program-highlight">
                <h3>Success Story</h3>
                <p><em>"The Kallar Village Development Committee was formed five years ago with support from GSS. Initially dependent on us for everything, the committee underwent intensive capacity building. Today, they manage a successful organic farming cooperative with 75 members, operate a community seed bank, run a bio-gas plant that supplies cooking gas to 40 households, and have mobilized ₹12 lakhs from government schemes for village infrastructure. They recently won the state award for 'Best Community-Managed Village Development Initiative' and now mentor other villages. Their transformation from beneficiaries to leaders is what grassroots empowerment is all about."</em></p>
