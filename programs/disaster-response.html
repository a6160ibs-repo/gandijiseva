                <h3>Success Story - 2021 Tamil Nadu Floods</h3>
                <p><em>"When unprecedented floods hit Kancheepuram district in 2021, the village of Perumbakkam was completely submerged. Within 24 hours, our team reached the village with rescue boats, evacuating 150 families to safety. We established a relief camp providing hot meals, medical care, and emotional support for three weeks. After waters receded, we provided each family with ₹10,000 cash assistance, food kits, kitchen sets, and agricultural inputs. We reconstructed 12 homes that were completely destroyed. Today, Perumbakkam has a trained disaster response team and an early warning system. During the 2023 monsoon, they successfully evacuated 200 families before flooding, preventing any casualties."</em></p>
